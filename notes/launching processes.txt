Launching processes
-------------------
- How do MRBs launch new SRBs, and how do SRBs launch new Workers?

- In particular, there may be multiple MRBs, SRBs and Workers
  - These may be on different machines.
  - If we get a number of requests at the same time, we do not (necessarily) want
    to create multiple processes.
    - For example, say a client sends 5 requests for a service
      - Initially there are no SRBs or Workers for them
      - The MRB gets the first request
      - So the MRB needs to create an SRB for the right version
      - Before it has started up, it gets the second request
      - It wants not to create another SRB, as it could be handled by the one being created
      - Equally, once the SRB has been created, it may not want to create multiple Workers

- On the other hand, sometimes we *may* want to create multiple proceses, for example:
  - A client sends 10000 requests for a particular request-type
  - We decide (or have config) that specifies that a maximum of 1000 requests
    should be handled by any one process
  - So: The SRB should know that it needs to create 10 processes
 

- QUESTION: How does the MRB get the inbox of a new SRB? And an SRB get the inbox of a new Worker?


Basic architecture / system
---------------------------
- Could we start with a system that had:
  - Only one MRB
  - Only one SRB per request-type and version?
  - Does not do calculation-sharing 
  - *Does* create multiple Workers if needed



Workflow for starting Worker processes
--------------------------------------
- SRB receives a new request

Folder structure
----------------
- SMC (simple microservices container)
  - SMCService: all it does is launch the Launcher
  - [service-name] - eg,BNPP.FPG.MatrixGenerationService (names are best scoped like this)
    - [versions] - each version in its own folder
      - SRB and calculation dll
      - All dependencies


Notes
-----
- Service names may be best scoped / namespaced to avoid name clashes, for example:
  - BNPP.FPG.MatrixGeneration      
  - SMC.SystemInfo

- Version folders could be quite large
  - As they hold all dependencies of the service
  - There could be a lot of overlap with other services
  - So this is quite wasteful of disk space.
    - But disks are (should be) big and cheap.

- Ultimately we will not be able to deploy every service to every server
  - There will be too many

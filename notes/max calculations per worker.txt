How do we manage the maximum number of calculations per worker?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Answer 1
--------
- In the calculation library
  - With a default.
  - Overridable in config

- The Service (calculation) base class has a get_maximum_requests_per_worker() method
  - This defaults to some value (say 1000)
  - You can override this for your own service - as you know how heavy / slow it is

- We could also have (optional) persisted config per service
  - Can override the maximum requests per worker
  - Can override which servers to use for the service
  - SRBs subscribe for this data
    - And only create Workers when they have it
    - They have to wait, as the servers may be restricted

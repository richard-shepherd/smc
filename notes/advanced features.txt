Advanced features
-----------------
- Client-specific prioritization / resource allocation

- Automatic discovery of nearest Master Request Brokers
  - Load-balancing between MRBs
    - Maybe via data broadcast to clients
    - Ping time to each MRB
    - Current load of each MRB (requests / sec)

- Automated testing tool for services

- Admin tools (web-based?) to:
  - View active services
  - View active MRBs and SRBs
  - View load on services and brokers (messages / sec in and out, CPU, memory)
  - View load on servers
  - Overall capacity gauges (dials) for whole system
    - Ability to drill in to:
      - Sub-systems (regions)
      - Individual servers
      - Individual services
  - Filter by client
  - Filter by service (as the services could be on any server)

- Ability to create services before they are needed

- Abilty to pin services to servers
  - And exclude servers from general use, ie reserve them for certain services

- Launcher also acts as a deployer to put new versions on servers

- Allocation of different services (or groups of services) to different groups of servers
  - (Initially all services will be available on all servers???)

- Sharing of calculations
  - ie, if two clients ask for the same data or calculation, we only calculate it once

- Initially we will have one SRB per version (per location)
  - Later we will need to be able to load-balance between multiple SRBs
  - AND: They need to have decentralized logic to manage sharing of calculations
    - ie, they need to know which calculations are active from other SRBs
    - (This could be a "best efforts" system, and if not perfect then some repeated calcs 
      would be done, but many would be shared.)

- Graph: It would be very good if nodes could be defined in multiple libraries (dlls)
  - These would be loaded on-demand if other nodes needed them.
  - So: Maybe nodes have a section to express their library dependencies (as well as their actual parents)

- Tool to determine which versions of services are used
  - And to clean up unused versions

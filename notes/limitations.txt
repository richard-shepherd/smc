Limitations
-----------
- What are the limitations of the framework? Compared with:
  - DSC
  - LQ2
  - The Wire
  - Google global distribution


DSC
---
- Can it do everything that DSC can? DSC provides these things:
  - Persisted config as live data and distributes it globally
  - Fairly low-latency messaging for live updates
  - Broadcast data to multipe clients
  - Last value caching
  - Subscriptions to live data
  - On-demand requests for data / streams
  - Backwards compatibility of data / messages between versions
  - Visibility of (most) data in the system



Market data
-----------
- How suitable is this to deliver market-data
  - Perhaps to other services?

- Answer 1: It can deliver streaming market-data with (fairly) low latency

- Answer 2: In your own services, you do not have to only use data from other
            services in this framework. You can go direct to other data-sources.

- Answer 3: Unless feed-handlers are built as these services, there is always an
            extra hop in getting data via a service.

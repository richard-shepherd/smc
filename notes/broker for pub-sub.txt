Broker for pub / sub?
---------------------
- Most messaging between components in point-to-point
  - Maybe PUSH / PULL in ZMQ?

- BUT: For some data, we reall need a more standard pub / sub mechanism
  - And this needs to be reliable (unlike ZMQ pub / sub) so that a publisher
    can connect and immediately publish, and subscribers can receive it
  - It also needs to manage LVC-style info

- This will hold current system state like:
  - The collection of running processes and their info (connection inboxes etc)


How does this work with ZMQ?
----------------------------




The only hard-coded / config info for the system?
-------------------------------------------------
- Maybe this is the only hard-coded info for the system

- All other components register with it
  - And are discovered by subscribing to its data

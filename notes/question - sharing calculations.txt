How will calculation sharing work?
----------------------------------
- If two clients ask for the same calculation, we would like
  to calculate it only once, and publish it to both clients.

- Note 1: We need to be careful about scalability, depending on how
          data is broadcast to clients.
          If it is done as a TCP "broadcast" then it will slow down
          the publisher as we add more clients.

- Note 2: We onyl want to share if the clients are asking for the same 
          version of the calculation (eg, v2.1.3) as values may be different
          between different versions.

- Question: With the MRB and SRB, how do we find the process that is already 
            calculating a value?

- Say we have 100 servers, all calculating IRS for various parameters
  - The parameters are specified in the client request:
    - Market details (JSON info)
    - Swap details (say in binary data for a custom swap)
  - Each server holds a number of workers.

- The MRB cannot do the work, as it does not know anything about how
  to parse the request.

- Answer 1: There is one SRB per version. All requests for the service-type and
            version (in one location) are handled by it.
            It can keep info about which requests are managed in which workers.
            It can then forward identical requests to the same worker.
            Workers ref-count the requests.

- Answer 2: We will need to have multiple SRBs (per version & location) in the future.
            They will need to share some information about what each other are doing.
            There could be a central "database" (or other service holding this info).

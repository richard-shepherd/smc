How do we persist config?
-------------------------
- We need to persist various pieces of data. For example:
  - List of all servers in an environment
  - Service specific info
    - Override for max requests per worker
    - verride for which servers to use

- This data needs to be:
  - Persisted
  - Loaded at startup
  - Editable
  - Available as live, subscribable updates
  - ie, like DSC config

- We need a GUI to interact with this
  - A C# GUI?
  - A web interface?
